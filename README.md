Use of Dimension reduction technique (Principal Component Analysis) to decrease the features of the data  '

Principal Component Analysis is the technique used to reduce the dimensions on the large datasets. The comparable measurements are shown by the variables, and the components are generated on the basis of the covariance matrix's Eigen decomposition.

The project is implemented on IBM SPSS. 

I. Data suitability for PCA
A. Sample size plays an important role for the analysis of the PCA. The dataset which is used consists of 21 columns and 89 rows which is suitable for the analysis of the PCA. 

B. Correlations among the variables are checked. It was found that there is not much correlations among the variables. Out of 21, only 3 to 4 variables are highly correlated, which will not influence the study much.

C. Bartlettâ€™s Test of Sphericity checks the correlation between the two features which are zero. The test checks the significance value i.e. p value which should be less than 0.05 (p<0.05). 

D. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure the correlations explained by the other variables. The value of this is maximum of 1. For good calculation the value of KMO must exceed 0.5 and 
near to 1

E. Eigenvalues is total variance measured by the features or the variables for the factor. For a particular factor it is total of squared factors. The largest eigen values has a maximum variance.

F. Communalities table shows weather to include or exclude the variable. The factor with the value greater than 0.30 is considered or recommended to take according to the study. Communalities are the sum of the squared loading h2. When divided by the number of factors the resultant value is explained to be the total variance by the first two factors.
